# Runtime Gateway protocol

`@control-plane/runtime-gateway-protocol` is the provider-neutral, versioned wire contract between the cloud Runtime Gateway and outbound RuntimeNode connections. It is distinct from the product HTTP/SSE API and never carries user-session or reusable device/provider credentials.

## Envelope and delivery rules

Every envelope identifies its schema and negotiated protocol version, node, workspace, channel generation, sequence, trace, and send time. Commands additionally require a stable command ID, idempotency key, content digest, issue/expiry timestamps, driver family/version, capability requirements, and semantic command family. Transport is at least once: redelivery reuses the same command ID and payload hash, while a hash mismatch fails closed.

Payloads are either bounded adapter-owned JSON or a content-addressed Artifact reference. Core validation rejects native provider command types and selectors for arbitrary endpoints, local paths, executables, databases, projects, source scopes, or reusable credentials. Context-provider status/read operations are optional; writes require a separate authorization reference. Inventory may advertise zero providers without affecting runtime negotiation.

The checked-in JSON Schema and golden/malformed JSON fixtures under `packages/runtime-gateway-protocol` are language-neutral. The TypeScript package depends only on Zod and includes a deterministic reference RuntimeNode plus a reusable conformance runner; consumers do not need Control Plane server, domain, or database packages.

## Compatibility and deprecation

Peers negotiate the highest common major version and the lower supported minor within that major. No common major fails negotiation. Additive fields and envelope variants require a minor version; changed meanings, required-field removal, or incompatible validation require a new major. Deprecation must name the affected version and timestamp; an optional sunset must be later than deprecation and should name a supported replacement. A command already past expiry is never made valid by protocol negotiation or reconnect.
